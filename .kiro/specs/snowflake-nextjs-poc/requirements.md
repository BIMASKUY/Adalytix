# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Proof of Concept (POC) Next.js application that directly queries Snowflake using the Snowflake SQL REST API from the client-side. The application will fetch analytics data and display it in both a line chart visualization and a raw data table. This is a temporary POC focused on functionality rather than security or production-readiness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Snowflake API Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to query Snowflake directly from the Next.js frontend using the SQL REST API, so that I can quickly prototype data visualization without setting up a backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL execute a fetch() call to the Snowflake SQL REST API endpoint at `https://<account>.snowflakecomputing.com/api/v2/statements`
2. WHEN making the API request THEN the system SHALL include authentication credentials (account, username, password/token) in the request headers
3. WHEN the API request is made THEN the system SHALL send the SQL query `SELECT DATE, TIME, METRIC FROM BIMA_DUMMY_DB.PUBLIC.HOURLY_ANALYTICS LIMIT 10;`
4. WHEN the API responds THEN the system SHALL parse the JSON response and extract the data rows
5. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message to the user

### Requirement 2: Data Visualization with Line Chart

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the analytics data displayed as a line chart, so that I can quickly understand trends in the metrics over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is successfully fetched from Snowflake THEN the system SHALL render a line chart using Chart.js or Recharts
2. WHEN rendering the chart THEN the system SHALL use the DATE and TIME fields for the x-axis
3. WHEN rendering the chart THEN the system SHALL use the METRIC field for the y-axis
4. WHEN the chart is displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper labels and formatting for readability
5. IF no data is available THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no data to visualize

### Requirement 3: Raw Data Table Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the raw query results in a table format below the chart, so that I can inspect the exact values returned from Snowflake.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is successfully fetched from Snowflake THEN the system SHALL render a data table below the line chart
2. WHEN rendering the table THEN the system SHALL display columns for DATE, TIME, and METRIC
3. WHEN rendering the table THEN the system SHALL display all rows returned from the query (up to 10 rows)
4. WHEN the table is displayed THEN the system SHALL format the data in a readable manner with proper column headers

### Requirement 4: Configuration and Credentials Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear instructions on where to place Snowflake credentials, so that I can easily configure the application for my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the system SHALL include example placeholder credentials (account, username, password/token)
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the system SHALL include comments indicating where to replace placeholders with real credentials
3. WHEN credentials are needed THEN the system SHALL use environment variables or a clearly marked configuration section
4. WHEN the application is set up THEN the developer SHALL be able to replace credentials without modifying multiple files

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and CORS Workarounds

**User Story:** As a developer, I want quick workarounds for CORS and authentication issues, so that I can get the POC running without complex infrastructure setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF CORS errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide instructions or code for a local proxy workaround
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with troubleshooting hints
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and display a user-friendly message
4. IF the Snowflake API returns an error response THEN the system SHALL parse and display the error details

### Requirement 6: Next.js TypeScript Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to run successfully in a new Next.js TypeScript project without import or runtime errors, so that I can quickly deploy the POC.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is added to a Next.js project THEN the system SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL not produce runtime errors related to imports or dependencies
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL only require standard Next.js dependencies plus the chosen charting library
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL render successfully in a browser without console errors
