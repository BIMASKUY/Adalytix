# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing Next.js Snowflake POC by adding an interactive chatbot interface. Users will be able to type natural language queries, send them to Snowflake, and receive both text responses and visual chart representations when applicable. The chatbot will reuse the existing chart rendering logic from the POC and maintain the clean Tailwind styling already established in the project.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with Snowflake through a chat interface, so that I can query data using natural language instead of writing SQL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads the page THEN the system SHALL display a chat interface with a messages list, text input field, and send button
2. WHEN the user types a message in the input field THEN the system SHALL enable the send button
3. WHEN the user clicks the send button OR presses Enter THEN the system SHALL add the user's message to the chat history
4. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL clear the input field and prepare for the next message
5. IF the chat container has multiple messages THEN the system SHALL be scrollable with the latest message visible

### Requirement 2: Message Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my messages and Snowflake's responses clearly differentiated, so that I can easily follow the conversation flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL display it as a right-aligned chat bubble with distinct styling
2. WHEN Snowflake responds THEN the system SHALL display the response as a left-aligned chat bubble with distinct styling
3. WHEN displaying messages THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS classes for consistent styling with the existing POC
4. WHEN multiple messages exist THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing and visual hierarchy between messages

### Requirement 3: Snowflake Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want my chat messages to be sent to Snowflake and receive responses, so that I can get data insights through conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL make a POST request to the Snowflake API endpoint
2. WHEN the API request is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator in the chat
3. IF the API returns a text response THEN the system SHALL display it in the chat as a Snowflake message
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message in the chat
5. WHEN the API response is received THEN the system SHALL parse both text and chart data from the response

### Requirement 4: Chart Rendering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual charts when Snowflake returns chart data, so that I can better understand data patterns and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Snowflake response includes chart data THEN the system SHALL render a chart below the text response
2. WHEN rendering charts THEN the system SHALL use Chart.js library for visualization
3. WHEN rendering charts THEN the system SHALL reuse or adapt the existing chart logic from the Snowflake POC
4. WHEN displaying a chart THEN the system SHALL wrap it in a card component with proper Tailwind styling
5. IF no chart data is present in the response THEN the system SHALL only display the text response

### Requirement 5: Client-Side Rendering

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chatbot to use client-side rendering with Next.js App Router, so that it integrates seamlessly with the existing POC architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the chatbot THEN the system SHALL use the 'use client' directive in app/page.tsx
2. WHEN managing chat state THEN the system SHALL use React hooks (useState, useEffect)
3. WHEN the component mounts THEN the system SHALL initialize with an empty chat history
4. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL follow Next.js App Router conventions

### Requirement 6: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to be clean, type-safe, and error-free, so that it can run immediately in a fresh Next.js setup without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript with proper type definitions
2. WHEN the code is executed THEN the system SHALL have zero runtime errors
3. WHEN the code is executed THEN the system SHALL have zero import errors
4. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL follow React best practices
5. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS classes consistently
6. WHEN the feature is complete THEN the system SHALL be runnable in a fresh Next.js + Tailwind + Chart.js setup

### Requirement 7: Minimal Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple, minimal implementation without backend complexity, so that I can quickly prototype and test the chatbot interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the chatbot THEN the system SHALL keep the implementation simple and focused
2. WHEN implementing the chatbot THEN the system SHALL not require additional backend services beyond the existing Snowflake API
3. WHEN implementing the chatbot THEN the system SHALL reuse existing components and utilities where possible
4. WHEN implementing the chatbot THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing project structure
